Additive partitioning of multi-species distributional aggregation for sequential sampling

This repository contains 1) calculation and simulation code for conducting additive partitioning of multi-species distributional aggregtaion pattern; 2) the original amphibian community dataset collected in central-south Vietnam using line transects. The amphibian dataset was used in the following paper for empirical dataset of the additive partitioning of multi-species distributional aggregation pattern:
